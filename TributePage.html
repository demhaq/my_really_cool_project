         	<p>“He stood for something that he really believed in,” the five times champion heavyweight said. “To take it upon yourself to say ‘I am the greatest’ you put yourself in position as a target. People said ‘who could do that three times?’ – that is what Ali did. It was a great accomplishment.”</p>
